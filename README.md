# FileVault – UI/UX Landing Page

## Project Overview
This project was created as part of a UI/UX skill assessment.  
The focus is on **clean layout, usability, accessibility, and visual hierarchy** rather than backend functionality.  
All interactions are lightweight placeholders to demonstrate user flow and design intent.
